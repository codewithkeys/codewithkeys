### Hi there 👋

My name is Yoly Keys, a Chicago native who has a passion for technology and innovation. I enjoy nothing more than learning the trends that technology is shaping in order for us to work more efficiently and see advancement and success. I've recently decided to take a leap of faith and join a team of like-minded enthusiasts in mastering a programming language that has evolved from humble beginnings to power a large share of today’s digital world. Welcome to my digital abode.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on saving the planet from Elon Musk.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Software Engineering Backend Development.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on mobile apps, web apps, and desktop apps.
- 💬 Ask me about a super power I had in my previous life.
- 📫 How to reach me: yoly@codewithkeys.com
- ⚡ Fun fact: I'm terrified of clowns
- 😄 Pronouns: they/them
